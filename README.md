Hi, I'm Ben Polson, a senior at Cornell University, studying statistics and minoring in computer science. I have interests in data science
and quantitative trading. I am anticipating getting my Masters of Engineering in computer science with a graduation date of December 2023. Feel free to check out some of the projects I have worked on!
