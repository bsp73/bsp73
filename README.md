Hi, I'm Ben Polson, a junior at Cornell University, studying statistics and minoring in computer science. I have interests in data science
and quantitative research. This fall, I hope to become experienced in machine learning and time series. So far, I have made progress in
a crypto trading algorithm, and I plan to create several data science projects and a stock trading algorithm soon!
